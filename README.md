Hi, I am Zain Ul Abiden, graduating May 2021 with a Masters degree in Information Systems from The University of Texas at Arlington.

- I entered this field of study with no prior experience or knowledge, because of how it challenges me at every step and forces me to think outside of the box. 
- The amount of information you can extract from raw data and use it in your favor is one of the biggest reasons why I grew an interest in this field and wanted to learn more.

- Took classes like Python Programming, Data Mining, Data Science and Database Warehousing during my program.
- Currently learning Java programming and getting used to BI tools such as Tableau and Power BI. 

I am super excited to start my journey in this field and I cannot wait to see where it takes me!
